## Description
Using Simulated Annealing to optimize for best Wine quality

## Using Simulated Annealing to optimize machine model inputs

There are various approaches that one can take to reverse-engineer a trained
machine learning model and we explore this problem by implementing simulated
annealing (SA). SA can be used to optimize over discrete search domains such as
over the wine characteristics like acidity and pH to find the best quality wine.
This example illustrates the potential of applying SA to other problems perhaps
with larger but sparser datasets.

## Notebook 1: optimization_of_wine_quality_compare_cooling_method

Explored various hyperparmeter for SA algorithm such as the temperature decreasing rules (linear vs exponential, etc.)

## Notebook 2: optimization_of_wine_quality_linear

This is the start of my foray into the SA optimization technique on an empirical
dataset to find optimal ranges of parameters for high quality Portuguese wine.
